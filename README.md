**Live Demo**: [https://glowing-belekoy-b7c471.netlify.app/](https://glowing-belekoy-b7c471.netlify.app/)

## 📌 Project Description

This is a simple React-based counter application demonstrating two approaches to building React components:

### ✅ Objectives:

1. **Class Component Counter**  
   - Implements a counter using React's class-based component approach.  
   - Supports increment and decrement functionality via `+` and `-` buttons.

2. **Functional Component Counter**  
   - Implements a counter using React's functional component approach.  
   - Utilizes the `useState` hook to manage state.  
   - Also supports increment and decrement functionality via `+` and `-` buttons.

This project serves as a fundamental comparison between class components and functional components with hooks.
